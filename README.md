# MdXform (Metadata Transformations)

This simple Web application is a first pass at a server-based metadata transformation engine.  It's a bit of a skunkworks project, started over the weekend (as a result of scope creep on a scripting project).  It may or may not be something we develop further.

## Getting Started

To run, from within the project directory, type:

    mvn jetty:run
    
Then go to localhost port 9191 (or whatever port you've configured in the pom.xml file) to view.  To stop, type:

    mvn jetty:stop
    
That's it!
